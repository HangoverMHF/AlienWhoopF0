## DIY Flight Controller :alien:
If you fancy doing it yourself (DIY), and have the right equipment and patience, building an AlienWhoop ZER0 from scratch can be tremendously satisfying--though not for the faint of heart. After doing your homework the first step is to place an order for blank PCBs from [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) ... Shared Project link coming soon:
* We recommend ordering the 2oz copper 0.8mm thickness PCB
  * *It takes about three weeks to make the thin boards which allows plenty of time to order components from the bill of materials in the resources folder.*

~ Please note: **AlienWhoop** is not affiliated with nor endorsed by AlienFlight or forks of Lance's work such as AlienFlight NG. The use of Alien in the name and the alien head vector graphic used on the board silkscreen are nods to the lineage of this remix and to the work of Lance and others who created the conditions for this project to arise. Likewise, AlienWhoop is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Tiny Whoop. The Whoop in the name comes from Jesse Perkin's fantastic Tiny Whoop ("a small first-person-view aircraft that truly allows you to feel the gift of flight and the feeling of being tiny" [tinywhoop.com]) and is simply a nod to his efforts and the TW community worldwide.
